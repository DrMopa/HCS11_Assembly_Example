# HCS11_Assembly_Example

*Note* HCS11 & HCS12 instruction set are very similar, with no modification this LCT file can be compiled in HCS12 as well.

This short peace of code was used in conjunction with an HCS11 Microprocessor, it is a short and sweet example of how to control an LED with a button input. 

This is a much simpiler example to the Liquid crystal display controller that is also available in a seporate reposity on my DrMopa Account
