# HCS11_Assembly_Example

This short peace of code was used in conjunction with an HCS11 Microprocessor, it is a short and sweet example of how to control an LED with a button input. 

Unfortunately, I’ve lost most of my work that I’ve done on the HCS11 assembly language, as previously I had configured the HCS11 board to control a liquid crystal display and accept a short list of keystrokes to report to the screen. But again, I’ve lost this code. If pressed, I’m sure I can reconstruct something similar.
